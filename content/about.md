I work with infrastructure and production systems — building, automating, fixing, and occasionally swearing at them. After 10+ years in the industry, I still enjoy making things scale, stay online, and keep costs under control. I’ve worked across multi-cloud setups, automated everything that moves (and some things that don’t) using Kubernetes and IaC, and chased down bugs that only show up under pressure.

I write Go when Bash gets annoying — mostly to create tools that make infra more reliable and less painful. I care about clean configs, strong monitoring, and systems that don’t require a ritual to deploy. I like tricky problems: flaky services, weird alerts, and mysterious performance issues — especially when no users are suffering, or better yet, noticing at all.

I live in Amsterdam, grapple in a gi, and keep the systems running and myself too. One day I plan to retire as a freediving instructor — I’ve even done a few dives, so technically I’ve started.
